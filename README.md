Objective: For a Stock Trading News Alert Project, the objective typically involves developing a system that monitors and analyzes real-time news and market data to identify significant events or trends that could impact stock prices. 

Background:I have been investing in tech companies such as Tesla, Apple, NVIDIA, Meta, and Microsoft for the past 5 years. I am interested in developing a program that allows me to collect news and price data about specific technology companies, such as Tesla, in which I'm most heavily invested. There are some ways to collect and see the stock data such as google finance and yahoo finance sites. However, I wanted to develop my own stock trading news alert system. I chose this Python project because I wanted to use this opportunity to learn how to connect to open APIs and web scraping techniques. The direction of development is to use open APIs, collect news data, and notify price changes via SMS. To develop additionally a program that lists YouTube videos based on the titles of companies I am investing in and saves the list as a CSV file. Based on what I learned and code from Udemy, I would like to further develop a web crawling program that creates a YouTube list.
